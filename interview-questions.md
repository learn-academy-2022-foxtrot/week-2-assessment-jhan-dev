# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer:    
    The difference between a parameter and an arguement is as the following. A parameter will be used as a temporary variable placce holder that will substitute as an input for a function. An argument will use actual variables that are declared to pass into a function to invoke.

Researched answer:  
    Parameters hold no hard value, while arguments pass value during an invoking function.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer:
    Parameters that are typically required for the use of the map() method is an array parameter. Once that is established, a predefined variable such as element, index, or value can be used.

Researched answer:
    The element is used to iterate and represent the current value inside of the array. 

    The index is used to identify the current index position iterating in the array.

    The array represents the array the map() method is invoked upon.

    The callbackFn is used to call a function to iterate every element of an array. Each call of callbackFn will return the value to a newArray.

    (OPTIONAL) The thisArg is used as a value to use this when running callbackFn



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer:    
    The Map() method will take in an array to iterate and output a new array with the same length as the original.

    The Filter() method will take in an array to iterate and output specific values from the array that match the conditions or parameters inside of the original array and output a subset of the original array.

Researched answer:
    .map() is a JavaScript functiion that will iterate a given array without mutating or changing the parent array.

    .filter() is a JavaScript function that will create a segmented copy of the given array, fitering down the elements by passing test implemented in the function.


4. What is iteration?

Your answer:
    Iteration is another way of saying looping. Iteration is used in loops to continously run a set of code until a specific stop condition is met.

Researched answer:
    Iteration is a continuous sequence that will repeat a process until a specific result is achieved by a predefined trigger.


5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer:
    A class is used to make a predetermined template that can mass produce new objects with predetermined key value pairs.

Researched answer:
    Class is a blueprint or template for which objects can mimic during creation.

    Object is an instance of a class that has properties of keys and pairs.


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer:
    I am not so sure what hoisting means. But if I had to take a guess, I think it will have something to do with raising some form of element. Whether a class or object perhaps.

Researched answer:
    Hoisting in JavaScript is used to place the invoking of either a class, function or variable ahead or before the class blueprint, function logic, or variable. Variables can be hoisted only by declaration and not initialization.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories:    
    Is a detailed description of a specific function or feature of an app.

2. Spread operator:
    The spread operator (...) is used to quickly copy all or partial of an array or object.

3. React:
    React is a free, open source front-end library for UI based features developed specifically for JavaScript

4. React props:
    Props is short for properties and they objects that are read-only components that cannot be modified.

5. DOM events:
    DOM (Document Object Model) represents the webpage in a tree structure providing a top down approach to access or modify any HTML element easily.
